Please take a look at the following guidelines before creating a new issue.

1. Have you searched the issue archive to see if your question has already been answered or reported?

2. If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to deal with issues efficiently by providing the following information:

   * Motivation / Use Case - explain why this is an issue for you
   * Version - which version of sciencefair are you using?
   * Operating System - what version are you using?
   * Node and npm versions - it may also be useful to include the output of `npm list`
   * Related issues - has a similar issue been reported before?
